# FFI

Occasionally, working with unsafe javascript is more convenient, such as working with a library written in JS.

Purescript offers typed FFI to javascript to allow for flexibility and broader ecosystem integration.

Purescript also offers tools necessary to make an unsafe JS call into a safe Purescript function.

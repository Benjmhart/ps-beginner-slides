# TypeClasses & Constraints

If we want to _do_ something with a type variable in our function, we can qualify it with a `Constraint`.

Constraints tell us that the type we are dealing with is a member of a club that allows use to perform certain actions, even if the type itself is not known. 
`Show` - allows us to print the data as a string
`Eq` - allows us to compare two values of that type for equality
`Ord` - allows us to rank values as Greater Than, Less than, Equal.

These can allow us to perform operations on a variable type
```purescript
equal :: forall a. (Eq a) => a -> a -> Boolean
equal x y = x == y
```

Here we can see that the `Eq` typeclass is allowing us to use `==` as a comparison operator.

The type checker can verify at compile time that any type we supply as an argument to `equal` is a member of the TypeClass `Eq`.

The type checker will also verify that the first and second argument above are of the same type. (type variables must match up, they are not a wildcard each time).

# Introduction to Purescript

- Purescript is:
  - A purely functional programming language based on haskell
  - compiles to/interacts with Javascript.
  - Strong, statically typed
  - Whitespace driven (kinda like python)
  - Expression language
  - Immutable, Pure, and Total by default

- Advantages over JavaScript:
  - Turn runtime errors into compile time errors
  - Easier to make changes without breaking code
  - Fully declarative (get more done with less)
  - terse, expressive

# Basic Syntax

Values/constants are declared with an `=`

```purescript
x = 5

y = x * 2
```

Functions are also declared using an `=` 

```purescript
add a b = a + b

addOne b = add 1 b

two = addOne (3 - 2)
```
**JS equivalents:**
```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b

const addOne = b => add(1, b)

const two = addOne(3 - 2)
```

Purescript looks a bit like coffeescript.

Each function parameter/argument is seperated only by spaces.

A function identifier on the left of `=` will always return the results on the right.

A function or value should always be equivalent to it's representation - This is called referential transparency.

The language has many inline operators, and you can create your own

lightweight, customizable syntax 
  + referential transparency 
  + types, currying
  + Equational (algebraic) reasoning
